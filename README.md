# Switch-Mode-Power-Supply-

Welcome to my ongoing project focused on developing a low-cost, efficient, fast-switching SMPS with the following target specs. I'm documenting everything here, from design decisions, simulations, datasheets, updates, and testing as I go.

## üìå Upcoming Updates
I will be adding:
- Schematic
- Calculations
- Testing Files
- Results

# Design in Progress
‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a work-in-progress. I'm currently:

Researching topologies (Flyback, Forward, LLC, etc.)
Running LTSpice/PSIM/TINA simulations
Collecting and evaluating component datasheets (MOSFETs, controllers, transformers)
Experimenting with feedback and compensation loop designs
Planning layout for EMI control and thermal performance

# Stay Tuned
I'll be updating this repository with design decisions, simulation results, test setups, and learnings. Feedback and suggestions are welcome! If you're interested in power electronics, give this project a ‚≠êÔ∏è and follow along.
